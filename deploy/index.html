                        <p1>More sustainable fashion can be defined as clothing, shoes and accessories that are manufactured, marketed and used in the most sustainable manner possible, taking into account both environmental and socio-economic aspects. In practice, this implies continuous work to improve all stages of the product’s life cycle, from design, raw material production, manufacturing, transport, storage, marketing and final sale, to use, reuse, repair, remake and recycling of the product and its components. </p1>
                        <p2>From an environmental perspective, the aim should be to minimize any undesirable environmental effect of the product’s life cycle by: (a) ensuring efficient and careful use of natural resources (water, energy, land, soil, animals, plants, biodiversity, ecosystems, etc); (b) selecting renewable energy sources (wind, solar, etc) at every stage, and (c) maximizing repair, remake, reuse, and recycling of the product and its components. </p2>

                                <h1>WHY SUPPORT SUSTAINABLE CLOTHING BRANDS?</h1>
                                <p>Sustainability has become an increasingly important discussion as we hurtle towards breaching the limits of our planet and some say that fashion is the second most polluting industry in the world after oil and gas. Although this isn’t quite correct, as it is hard to estimate the impact of the fashion industry, the best estimate is between the 4th and 10th most polluting. Choosing sustainable fashion is an important choice that we can all make to help address what is a growing and significant issue. What is sustainable fashion and why does it matter? </p>
                                <p>The increasing speed with which clothing companies churn out products both creates and meets the desire of consumers for new clothes, shoes and bags, cheap, fast and now. This has changed the way we use clothes, ‘fast fashion’ means we aren’t re-wearing clothes as often as we used to, throwing them away sooner, possibly too soon as clothes have become seen as cheap and disposable. Items may only be worn a few times before being disposed of, some are not ever worn, left languishing in wardrobes. Yet we still buy more. </p>
                                <p>Fashion is driven by consumer choices, so collectively we can signal to the fashion industry that we not only want this revolution but we don’t want to wait for it. You can be part of this movement by being conscious of what you buy, who you buy it from and how often you buy clothes. This will create early signals and when more innovative and radical solutions come along to support them too.</p>

                        <h1>TRADITIONAL FASHION’S ENVIRONMENTAL FOOTPRINT
                        </h1>
                        <p>The classic definition of sustainability is the “avoidance of the depletion of natural resources in order to maintain an ecological balance” and fashion couldn’t be further from sustainable production. Fashion relies on a number of the other industries in the top 10 most polluting industries, like agriculture and road transportation, so if fashion could become more sustainable this could reduce the rate of environmental damage across the supply chain.
                        </p>
                        <p>The clothing industry employs millions of people worldwide so any changes to business models will have a significant impact for both large corporations who control production and the low-income workers in that produce the garments. This is going to be a difficult ship to change the course of. As it is also an industry that is plagued by waste and pollution it is one that will need to change course.
                        </p>
                        <p>There are a few companies involved in the fashion industry that are taking steps to address this harm but their efforts are small compared to the scale of the industry. The ‘Pulse of Fashion’ report estimates the progress of the fashion industry on sustainability measures and although there has been some progress, they emphasise that change isn’t far or fast enough and that most of the easy gains have already been made. A bigger revolution is going to be required.
