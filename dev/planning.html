                        <p1>More sustainable fashion can be defined as clothing, shoes and accessories that are manufactured, marketed and used in the most sustainable manner possible, taking into account both environmental and socio-economic aspects. In practice, this implies continuous work to improve all stages of the product’s life cycle, from design, raw material production, manufacturing, transport, storage, marketing and final sale, to use, reuse, repair, remake and recycling of the product and its components. </p1>
                        <p2>From an environmental perspective, the aim should be to minimize any undesirable environmental effect of the product’s life cycle by: (a) ensuring efficient and careful use of natural resources (water, energy, land, soil, animals, plants, biodiversity, ecosystems, etc); (b) selecting renewable energy sources (wind, solar, etc) at every stage, and (c) maximizing repair, remake, reuse, and recycling of the product and its components. </p2>

                                <h1>WHY SUPPORT SUSTAINABLE CLOTHING BRANDS?</h1>
                                <p>Sustainability has become an increasingly important discussion as we hurtle towards breaching the limits of our planet and some say that fashion is the second most polluting industry in the world after oil and gas. Although this isn’t quite correct, as it is hard to estimate the impact of the fashion industry, the best estimate is between the 4th and 10th most polluting. Choosing sustainable fashion is an important choice that we can all make to help address what is a growing and significant issue. What is sustainable fashion and why does it matter? </p>
                                <p>The increasing speed with which clothing companies churn out products both creates and meets the desire of consumers for new clothes, shoes and bags, cheap, fast and now. This has changed the way we use clothes, ‘fast fashion’ means we aren’t re-wearing clothes as often as we used to, throwing them away sooner, possibly too soon as clothes have become seen as cheap and disposable. Items may only be worn a few times before being disposed of, some are not ever worn, left languishing in wardrobes. Yet we still buy more. </p>
                                <p>Fashion is driven by consumer choices, so collectively we can signal to the fashion industry that we not only want this revolution but we don’t want to wait for it. You can be part of this movement by being conscious of what you buy, who you buy it from and how often you buy clothes. This will create early signals and when more innovative and radical solutions come along to support them too.</p>
